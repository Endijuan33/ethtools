# Ethereum Address Converter üîê

A secure, client-side web application to convert a BIP-39 mnemonic or an Ethereum private key to a public address. This tool is designed with security as a top priority‚Äî**all cryptographic operations run exclusively in your browser**. No sensitive data is ever transmitted to a server.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Client-Side Only**: All cryptographic processes, including key derivation, run securely within your browser.
- ‚úÖ **Mnemonic & Private Key Support**: Accepts both BIP-39 mnemonic phrases (12 or 24 words) and standard 64-character hexadecimal private keys.
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Network Support**: Seamlessly switch between Ethereum Mainnet and a variety of testnets, including Sepolia, Holesky, and others.
- ‚úÖ **Real-Time Balance Checker**: Instantly check the ETH balance of any derived or pasted address.
- ‚úÖ **ERC20 Token Support**: In addition to ETH, you can check balances for any ERC20 token by providing the contract address.
- ‚úÖ **Direct Explorer Integration**: One-click links to verify addresses and transactions on Etherscan or other relevant block explorers.
- ‚úÖ **Modern UI/UX**: A clean, responsive interface with a default dark theme and a convenient light/dark mode toggle.
- ‚úÖ **Built-in Security Warnings**: Clear, persistent warnings to educate users on security best practices.
- ‚úÖ **QR Code Support**: Generate a QR code for your public address for easy sharing.

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18.17.0 or higher.
- **Package Manager**: npm, Yarn, or pnpm (pnpm is recommended).

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ethereum-address-converter.git
    cd ethereum-address-converter
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    Choose your preferred package manager:

    ```bash
    # Using pnpm (recommended)
    pnpm install

    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Using Yarn
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**

    This project uses environment variables to manage RPC endpoints for different networks. Copy the example file to create your local configuration:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```

    Now, edit the `.env.local` file and add your RPC URLs. It is highly recommended to use a dedicated RPC provider for reliability.

    ```env
    # Mainnet RPC - public nodes are not recommended for production
    NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_MAINNET=https://eth.llamarpc.com

    # Testnet RPCs - replace with your own API keys
    NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_SEPOLIA=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY
    NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_HOLESKY=https://holesky.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY

    # Default network to display on load
    NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_NETWORK=mainnet
    ```

    **Recommended RPC Providers:**

    -   [Infura](https://infura.io) - Reliable, free tier available with API key.
    -   [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) - Robust, free tier available with API key.
    -   [QuickNode](https://quicknode.com) - High-performance, free tier available.
    -   [LlamaRPC](https://llamarpc.com) - Public, no API key needed, but not recommended for production use.

4.  **Run the Development Server**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### From Mnemonic

1.  Navigate to the application.
2.  Select the desired network (e.g., Mainnet, Sepolia).
3.  Paste your 12 or 24-word mnemonic phrase into the input field.
4.  Click **"Convert to Address"**.
5.  The corresponding public address will be displayed, along with a button to check its ETH balance.

### From Private Key

1.  Navigate to the application.
2.  Select the desired network.
3.  Paste your 64-character hexadecimal private key (the `0x` prefix is optional).
4.  Click **"Convert to Address"**.
5.  The public address will be displayed. You can reveal or hide your private key using the toggle button.

### Checking Balances

-   **ETH Balance**: After an address is generated, click **"Check Balance"** to see its ETH balance.
-   **ERC20 Token Balance**: To check a token balance, paste the token's contract address into the appropriate field and click the check button.
-   **Verify on Explorer**: Click the **"View on Explorer"** link to open the address on a block explorer like Etherscan for the selected network.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Available Scripts

This project uses `npm` scripts for common development tasks:

## üîí Security and Privacy

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Read Before Using

1.  **Client-Side Operation**: This application is designed to be completely client-side. **No private keys or mnemonics are ever sent to any server.**
2.  **No Data Storage**: The application does not store your sensitive information in `localStorage`, cookies, or any other persistent storage.
3.  **Secure Environment**: Only use this application on a trusted, malware-free device and a secure network.
4.  **Do Not Share Keys**: Never share your private key or mnemonic phrase with anyone, including the developers of this application.
5.  **Verify the URL**: Always ensure you are on the correct, official URL before entering any sensitive information.
6.  **Use HTTPS**: If deploying this application, ensure it is served over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Best Practices

-   ‚úÖ Use this tool for address derivation and verification, not for signing transactions.
-   ‚úÖ For significant funds, always use a hardware wallet.
-   ‚úÖ Double-check the address on a block explorer before sending any funds.
-   ‚úÖ Keep offline, encrypted backups of your mnemonics and private keys.
